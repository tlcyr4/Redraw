This text file is for standardizing naming conventions of buildings, colleges, etc
Each line represents a unique entity (e.g. a building)
Within each line, different names for the entity are separated by tabs.
The first entry in each line is the accepted standard other names should be converted to.

Before Use:
	Strip off " Hall" or " College"
	CAPITALIZE
	Split up shared buildings such as Baker, Wendell, and Forbes


Usage (python):

Read:

f = open("conventions.txt", "r")
line = ""
while line.strip("\n") != ("=" * 80):
	line = f.readline() #skip this documentation section
conventions = [line.strip("\n").split("\t") for line in f]
# conventions is now a list with a sublist for each entity

def standardized(name):
    found = False
    for c in conventions:
        if name in c:
            found = True    
            return c[0]
            break
    if not found:
        print "Error: Unknown Term: " + name
    return name


To Update:
Just add things manually in a text editor for now
Be careful adding new entities
