## Introduction
[Redraw](https://predraw.herokuapp.com) is a website built for Princeton undergraduate students and is equipped with an intuitive, fast, and powerful way of planning for Room Draw. The system allows students to find specific dorm rooms that would be the best fit for their campus life the following year. Using Redraw, students can connect to other students who are in their draw group to favorite potential rooms together.
A highly interactable GUI enhances the experience while providing detailed information about each of the rooms in every dorm building. The data available to the student body from the Housing Departmentâ€™s website is conveniently formatted and conveyed to the users.

## How To
### Environment Setup
Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for Python 3.x. Install pipenv from Brew
```sh
brew install pipenv
```
Download the dependencies from Pipfile
```sh
pipenv install
```
For developing, make sure you have a copy of node_modules. Install npm
```sh
npm install
```

### Run ReactJS Local
Run on the terminal (opens up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/))
```sh
npm start
```

### Run Django Local
Run on the terminal
```sh
./manage.py runserver
```
Open up [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

### Production Build
To get a production build after making changes to the front-end,
```sh
npm run build
```
This updates the 'build/' directory in the project 'root'.

## Other Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). There is a ReactJS frontend running with a Django backend, deployed through Heroku
