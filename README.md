## Product Guide
[Redraw](https://predraw.herokuapp.com) is a website built for Princeton 
undergraduate students and is equipped with an intuitive, fast, and 
powerful way of planning for Room Draw. The system allows students to 
find specific dorm rooms that would be the best fit for their campus 
life the following year. Using Redraw, students can connect to other 
students who are in their draw group to favorite potential rooms together.

A highly interactive GUI enhances the experience while providing detailed 
information about each of the rooms in every dorm building. The data 
available to the student body from the Housing Departmentâ€™s website is 
conveniently formatted and conveyed to the users.

Download the dependencies from Pipfile
```sh
pipenv install

For developing, make sure you have a copy of node_modules. Install npm
```sh
npm install

```sh
npm start
```

### Run Django Local
Run on the terminal
```sh
./manage.py runserver
```
Open up [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

### Production Build

```sh
npm run build
```
This updates the 'build/' directory in the project 'root'.
