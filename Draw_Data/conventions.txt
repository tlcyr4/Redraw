This text file is for standardizing naming conventions of buildings, colleges, etc
Each line represents a unique entity (e.g. a building)
Within each line, different names for the entity are separated by tabs.
The first entry in each line is the accepted standard other names should be converted to.

***Please strip off “ Hall” before using this, those don’t need to be added here***

Usage (python):

Read:

f = open("conventions.txt", "r")
line = ""
while line.strip("\n") != ("=" * 80):
	line = f.readline() #skip this documentation section
conventions = [line.strip("\n").split("\t") for line in f]
# conventions is now a list with a sublist for each entity


Update:
Just add things manually in a text editor for now
