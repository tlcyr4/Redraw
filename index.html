<P> Redraw is like PrincetonCourses, but for room draw. It helps students find the right place to live for the next year, by putting your entire room-draw planning process in one place. It does this through collaboration tools, using past years’ data to let you know how early rooms go, and the first full-fledged GUI for exploring your housing options.  Professor Brian Kernighan has often remarked about his time at Bell Labs on the importance of proximity, or “who’s next door”.  So, for the rest of your days at Princeton, who do you want next door?
